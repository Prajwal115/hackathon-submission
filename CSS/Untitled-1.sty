As population rose, the need for proper living condidtions increased. We built - cities, airports, houses to satify our desire.
Little did we know, that our desires became a huge threat to the nature.
We cleared the forests, We made animals homeless and most important of all - We threatened the nature.

To top it all off, the climate change posed a huge problem which not only can wipe the nature but humans too! 
With rapid advancement of technology - we built different machines to make our jobs easier and efficient. Machines like Fridges are known to be the greatest cause of global warming.
yes, The fridges. The coolants used in the refrigirators contain CFS which are known for Ozone Layer Depletion. The depletition of Ozone would lead to Skin Cancers, Cartaract and other harmful diseases in humans with the effect of UV rays.

At the same time, pollution rose the earth's temperature by about 4 degrees in recent years which can have a drastic impact. The glaciers in the Artic and Antartic are melting - which would lead in rising of ocean levels a 10 meters.
The air we breath, the water we drink and the sound we hear are unfortunetly are also getting affected.
Islands like Maldives, Tuvalu and Nauru would be completely submerged in water by 2040.

Air released from the cars and motorcyles contain Carbon Dioxide and Monooxides which don't allow the gases to leave the earth's atmosphere, but instead trap them - thus raising the temperature!

Throwing garbage in water bodies affect the lives of aquatic organisms. Discharge of Nuclear and Thermal waste can produce the defects in the future generations.

We utilize many resources everydays from Coal for heat to Natural Gas in the LPG. They are being utilized at a rapid rate and are on the verge of exaustion.
The development for better living conditions has to be done without compromising the need of the present generation but also looking at the future generations.
